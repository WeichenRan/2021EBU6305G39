                    <p>Bowl skimming, arc wall, deep abdomen, circle foot. The outer wall is covered with yellow glaze, and the enamel is painted with intertwined peony patterns. Four colorful peony flowers are in full bloom, decorated with several small flowers of various colors. The flowers are huge and full, and the branches and vines are intertwined, implying the auspicious meaning of "annual wealth". White glaze is applied on the inner wall and blue material color is applied on the outer bottom. In the columns on both sides, the words "made by Kangxi Emperor" are written in double lines. The font strokes are thick, wide, straight and dignified.</p>
                    <p>Enamel color is one of the precious color porcelain varieties created and burned during the Kangxi period. It was first made in 1696. The blank tire was first fired in Jingdezhen and transported to Beijing. It was hung and fired by the Ruyi hall in the palace. The copper tire painting enamel color material painting was placed on the porcelain tire. The Qing palace was called "porcelain tire painting enamel" and "foreign color" because "the pigment is also made from the west". Color material has transparent glass texture, also known as "color material". Its drawing skills, color material preparation, firing temperature and other aspects are not easy to master, firing is very difficult, and the number of production is limited. Therefore, enamel colored porcelain is very precious, which is specially used for the appreciation of palace emperors and concubines, as well as religious and sacrificial offerings. Kangxi enamel colored porcelain mostly imitates copper embryo painting enamel vessels, and mostly makes the ground in red, yellow, blue, purple, green, carmine and other colors. The painted patterns are decorated with peony, chrysanthemum, tuanfua, lotus, "longevity" character, "longevity" and so on. The painting is exquisite and neat, with a patterned decorative effect. The shapes are mostly small artifacts, including cups, bowls, plates, dishes, boxes, pots, etc., and there are few bottles.</p>
                    <p>The vessel is modeled on the enamel wrapped peony bowl painted by Kangxi copper tire, with dignified shape, thin tire and light body. The decoration technique is influenced by court painters such as Yun Nantian and Jiang Tingxi in the early Qing Dynasty. The peony is painted by boneless painting. The peony is beautiful, full of vitality, strong three-dimensional sense, and the color material is beautiful and pure. It is a rare product in Kangxi enamel porcelain. Kangxi enamel colored porcelain is very precious, and later generations scrambled to imitate it. The imitation of the Republic of China has loose tire quality, fine color materials, rigid drawing and weak style writing.</p>
