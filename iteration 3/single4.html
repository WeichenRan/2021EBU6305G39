                    <p>This bronze sword has a ridge in the middle and a sharp edge. The sword body is decorated with patterns, and the sword Tan is decorated with Turquoise animal face patterns. There are 10 characters in the seal script near Tan, "attacking (Wu) Wang fuchai makes his own yuan use", which is the sword used by Wu Wang fuchai. Many weapons have been found by the king of Wu. Fu Chai, the son of King Helu of Wu, succeeded to the throne in 495 BC, defeated Gou Jian, king of Yue the following year, and then turned to the north to dominate the Central Plains. In 482 B.C., fuchai, king of Wu, and Duke Ding of Jin formed an alliance in Huangchi (now the south of Shangqiu County, Henan Province).</p>
                    <p>The state of Wu, surnamed Ji, was a fief of the descendants of Taibo, the son of King Tai of Zhou. It was first granted by Zhou Zhang during the reign of King Wu of Zhou. It was all Wu (now Suzhou, Jiangsu). It had 12 dynasties of kings and was destroyed by the state of Yue in 473 BC. The most powerful period of the state of Wu was in the late spring and Autumn period. It once dominated the Central Plains for a short time, and Fu Chai, king of Wu, was the monarch of the most powerful period of the state of Wu. The spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period was an era of frequent wars, and the military needs promoted the development of weapon casting. The terrain of Wu and Yue is not suitable for vehicle warfare. There are many infantry, and the use of short weapons such as sword is very large. Therefore, the level of sword casting in Wu and Yue is far higher than that in the Central Plains. There are many famous swords admired by the world, and the vassal states are also proud to get the sword of Wu and Yue. The swords of this period were cast in bronze. A certain amount of tin, lead, iron, sulfur and other components were added to different parts to ensure the toughness of the sword body and the sharpness of the blade, so as to combine hardness and softness. At present, there are 9 bronze swords of "Fu Chai, king of Wu" unearthed and recorded, and their shapes and inscriptions are roughly the same.</p>
