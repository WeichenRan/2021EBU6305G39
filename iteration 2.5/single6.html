                    <p>There are 18 inscriptions on the bottom of this pendant, which was made by Uncle Lu for Ji Ji. Three concubines made by Uncle Lu have been unearthed in Shandong with the same shape and system. The state of Lu was a vassal state enfeoffed in the early Zhou Dynasty in the 11th century B.C. with the surname Ji. The founding monarch was Bo Qin, the eldest son of Duke of Zhou. It is located in Qufu, the capital of today's Southwest Shandong Province. In the spring and Autumn period, the state of Lu was weak, but it retained the most traditional culture of Zhou Dynasty. In the late spring and Autumn period, the Duke of the state of Lu was divided into three families: Jisun, mengsun and shusun. During the Warring States period, it became a small country and was destroyed by the state of Chu in 256 BC.</p>
                    <p>This bronze case is divided into two parts: a divider and a cover. The body has a female mouth, a bulging belly and a hoop foot. There are animal heads and ears on both sides of the belly, and there are protuberances under the ears. There are three animal heads and small feet under the hoop foot; The cover is raised and there is a catch in the center. The cover edge and the lower part of the mouth edge are decorated with an "s" shape, with eye poor curved patterns, the cover surface and the body are decorated with tile ridge patterns, the ring foot is decorated with vertical scale patterns, and there are also patterns in the center of the hand catching cover surface. Its shape is more common in bronze. It is the most popular style from the late Western Zhou Dynasty to the early spring and Autumn period.</p>
                    <p>Uncle Lu should be an important nobleman in the state of Lu, and Ji Ji should be his relatives. In the spring and Autumn period, the capital of the state of Lu was in Qufu, Shandong Province, but the location of this piece was not within the territory of the state of Lu; Combined with the nature of its concubines, it is speculated that the location of its excavation may be jijifu's house. There are also two bronze pendants handed down from the great father of Lu Bo. They are also concubines (made by Meng Jiang and Zhong Ji Yu respectively). They are now stored in the Palace Museum in Beijing and the Central Museum in Taiwan.</p>
